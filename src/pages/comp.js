   The Harvard Advocate has been a home for arts and literature at Harvard since 1866, and we're looking forward to meeting new members through our virtual Spring 2021 comp! Across its seven boards, The Advocate welcomes critics, artists, writers, designers, programmers, and dealmakers alike. No previous experience is necessary. You don’t have to be a writer or an artist—as long as you’re interested in what we do, Advo has a place for you. 
   The Advocate will be holding comps for all seven boards: Art, Features, Fiction, Poetry, Design, Business, and Tech.
