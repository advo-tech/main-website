                Unfortunately, due to the limitations imposed by the remote fall semester, The Harvard Advocate has decided to suspend its planned
                Fall 2020 comp. We feel that holding a comp remotely at present would pose issues of accessibility, due to varying degrees of access
                to digital resources, while preventing the magazine from welcoming new members to our community in a meaningful and substantive way.
                In lieu of a comp, we will be hosting open events, workshops, and projects â€” all of which will provide opportunities for new students
                to become involved in Advocate life. Please fill out the form linked <a href="https://forms.gle/9yopJaYJ8XToTbDc9">here</a> if you would like to be kept in the loop about ways to participate
                in Advocate activities this semester. We anticipate returning to our comp cycle in Spring 2021, with a redesigned comp that responds to the
                structure of the spring term.
