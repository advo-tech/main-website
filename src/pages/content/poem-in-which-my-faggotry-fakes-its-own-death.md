On the eighth day, coquelicot, 

wearing my Armageddon earring,



my faggotry jumped to its death

from the foam spire of its death.



& on the ninth: in paradise, titmice 

scrubbed its pearls with aftermath flax.



From its suicide note: So men might 

once again flip you buffalo nickels.



The being inside my having been so 

delicately razed itself into wondrous pink.



Meaning my faggotry carried all of astrology 

& I wanted only the varmint baubles,



little sex cowlick with which I coaxed

maw into morrow, morrow into morning.



How many times could I wake like that:

gowns & waxwings, the paler gust before



the gust that everyone remembers with a notch

in the wall when a prodigal boy molts past his pastness?



How many times could I join the hundred

apocryphal boys nursing their empire stitch?


Their faggotries, too, nixed themselves

with lovability’s long & bedazzled shears:


drowned in a tub filled with pink milk,

Alice’d by an extra-large bottle of Rush.


To build trust, we plunged the javelin of fey

suspicion, deep & darkling, inch by inch,


deeper into each other. I think we sought

a new unto, as in the boys we barely let 


ourselves struggle to be, as in two yuan

pieces, silver & tinkling, nearly crushing


each other into the bottom of a celadon

demitasse given as a gift by a lover who,


nightly, conspired to push our faggotry

from the glottal stopgap of the word


he never said but always meant: not fickle, no, 

not fanged—but blood, yes, & its heavy shimmer.
