My grandfather burned fires when we were kids  

down by the lake in a structure he made  

from stacked stones, the ash  

so soft and powdery, almost white.  

There were burnt shards of birch  

cracked and black as pieces  

of a sarcophagus. You can’t witness your own death,  

I remember someone saying in a seminar  

while we were discussing a Celan poem  

in which the speaker is digging  

through the ash. It was a Thursday,  

I drank a bottle of mineral water with Ronald,  

sun on Holbeinstraße, sun on Morgensternstraße.
