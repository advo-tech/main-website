Brief reprieve, then Junetime. The fledgling wins, just as\
it does every year. It rushes back rotten. When the last of\
the frost puddles, the bake-skinned child emerges, dumb\
&nbps;&nbps;&nbps;&nbps;&nbps;&nbps;again. The echo in my drums again. Elena, Elena.\
&nbps;&nbps;&nbps;&nbps;The once-remit light. I still answer to the name like a\
&nbps;&nbps;dog. Pluck the petals, bald seeds, worry leaves thin. Each\
blinding summer, the re-christening among the spindly paint-\
brushes. I, running behind the barn. The dried wheat thins,\
the frivolous blooming fields, a round-bellied robin giving\
&nbps;&nbps;&nbps;&nbps;&nbps;&nbps;chase. I’m tired of regrowth, the youth, the perpetual\
&nbps;&nbps;&nbps;&nbps;youth, the weeds and the boy with the shade hat. Lying\
&nbps;&nbps;peacefully atop my dull body, bugs landing heavy on their\
feet. I once held out my thumb, one brown eye closed, to blot\
out the sun. Just my little hand. Now the light tastes sour. The\
&nbps;&nbps;&nbps;&nbps;barn has grown empty and wet. The mold spread there for\
&nbps;&nbps;years, I’m told. When they were new, the pricks were clean,\
the sweet pear and cacti were shining and sweet. I place it all\
again as the light leaked this morning: every frenetic bone,\
&nbps;&nbps;&nbps;&nbps;every tooth-lodged seed, the sun in my skin. Landing any-\
&nbps;&nbps;where, light refracts broken onto me. Well, I opened my rickety\
fridge, the sudden cold relief, the wrinkles wrong. I ate every\
&nbps;&nbps;cherry, let them bleed in my mouth, putrid, forcing the swallow.
