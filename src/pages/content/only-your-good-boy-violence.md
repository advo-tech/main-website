   It was like
 
 

 palm trees in a line
 
   outside the building  



 I catch my sight

   by: I get it  
   
   
                       
 and it goes. Girl

 
  overtakes me  



in her leopard coat.

   Angora guy  
 
 
 
 sweeps up his zone.

   A river  

 
 
 slides behind

   the palms, and the sound.  



 I tune it all out

   too, each getting  



 a rush in. I get

   the feeling grows.

   I take  
 
    
 
 my pill daily,

   and the days go by  

   
   
a curb. I leave

   to cross,   

   
   
now, to turn

   the one-way.  

   
   
Not memory:

   I wear the jacket  

   
   
new, hand-painted

   blue. All over  

   
   
it was like:

   always meet  

   
   
your next in fuss

   -free pomade.  
  
  
  
Few wear gloves

   in warm winter.

   He swayed  

  

 as if he had me

   with his traps.  

  

 It was just down

   to his face.  

  

 When I inhaled

   the air of him  

  

 I felt as if

   I’d only know.  

  

 He was sweet

   when he talked.  

  

 His mouth closed up.

   Orange pullover  

  

 and a cling job.

   I came away,  

  

 not even changed

   by the ripeness of his lips.

   In that office  

  

I saw a plant 

   so green it was like:  

  

 I insist. Being

   nowhere else  

  

 became its own

   effect. I lacked  

  

 a window,

   so couldn’t  

  

 let in a wind,

   couldn’t upgrade  

  

 the moment to

   its movement as  

  

 I would have it:

   my body, proven;  

  

 the plant, hanging

   up and

   shaken.  

  

 It was like snow,

   unexpected.  

  

 Temporary

   yes, but there  

  

 I go, into it.

   There are beams  

  

 between buildings

   so that support  



 is some bird

   upon them.  

  

 Parallel

   facility:  

  

 I’m to say who.

   And don’t.  

  

 As if the good

   it does to be good

   for me now  

  

 won’t fall apart.

   I see a bench  

  

 on and on.

   Puffy boys  

  

 will motion to

   the dirty birds  

  

 it was like

   resistance  

  

 to notice, so

   I did. And do,  

  

 differentiating:

   the faster  

  

 you go, the lighter

   it feels, car-wise,  

  

 like memory.

   Because it was.
